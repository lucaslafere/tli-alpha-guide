This is much smoother for leveling because a lot of the XP you gain will be passive from the empower skill killing things, so CDR is arguably better here in the last trove of a1, equip dazzling bloom to help vs final boss of a1, can grind this trove to like 17 or so to get +1 minion in your first tree at 21 you get a 3rd support but at 22 you get ele fusion, make the 3rd support ele fusion at 27 you get mass effect for dazzling bloom, control spell, and magic dash at 34, spell amp at 50, swiftness</p>",
